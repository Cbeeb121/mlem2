# How to run the program
From the repository, in a terminal window:

1. run `ruby mlem2.rb`
2. pass a valid filename (ending in `.txt`) from the directory. You may use any of the `.txt` files already in the directory (austr.txt, test.txt, iris.txt, wine.txt)
3. You *MUST* include an input file from the directory for proper use
